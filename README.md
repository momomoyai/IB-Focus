# IB-Focus
An application for restricting unnecessary items in Tara's device to focus on IB (currently used to focus on other things).
Integrated with macOS's Shortcuts and only run in fixed paths.
Developed in an immediate situation to focus on IB External Assessment, thus purposed only for personal use.
